# Chapter 2
* Figure 2.23 top image incorrectly labels the y-axis as "strong" modulus, instead of "storage" modulus.

# Chapter 5
* Page 222, Equation 5.40: The first term on the right-hand side should start with 2/J not J/2 as written.
* Page 223, Equation 5.44: The second term on the right-hand side should contain $\lambda^4$ not $\lambda^2$ as written.
* Page 224, Equation 5.55: Most of the the time this equation is less useful than directly applying Equation 5.52.
* Page 225, on the middle of the page it says: and $\lambda=2$, which should be and $\lambda=\sqrt{2}$.
* Page 225, Equation 5.58, the number 2 should be $\sqrt{2}$.
* Page 253, Equation 5.113, the left-hand-side of the equation should be $\mathcal{L}^{-1}(x)$.
* Page 252, Equation 5.114, the left-hand-side of the equation should be $\mathcal{L}^{-1}(x)$.
* Page 263, Equation 5.125, the equation should be: $\displaystyle\sigma_{planar} = \mu \left( \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \right) \frac{J_m}{J_m - (\lambda^2 + 1/\lambda^2 - 2)}$.
* Page 263, Equation 5.126, the equation should be: $\sigma_{biax} = \mu \left( \lambda^2 - \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \right) \frac{J_m}{J_m - (2\lambda^2 + 1/\lambda^4 - 3)}$.

# Chapter 6
* On page 310, Section 6.2, last paragraph: "The approach is to perform a though experiment". It should be "thought experiment".
* Section 6.3 (Large Strain Linear Viscoelasticity) is missing a push-forward operator. The results are slightly wrong at very large strains without this correction.
* Equation (6.99) contains the equilibrium term $E_0$ which is not shownin Figure 6.13.

# Chapter 7
* On page 357, Section 7.2.2: Step 1 in the description of the algorithm does not the text $\varepsilon_0^p=0$, or ".., and $\varepsilon_0^p$ is the initial plastic strain."

# Chapter 8
* Page 388, just below Equation (8.30), the text $\dot{\gamma}_0 = 0$ should be $\dot{\gamma}_0 = 1$/s.
